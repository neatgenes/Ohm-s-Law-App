This is just a little project I decide to put some time into one night because I wanted to memorize Ohm's Law and it's variations. I might continue on and add more functionality to it, and if I get really damn bored I'll give it a GUI and make it pretty.
Anyone's welcome to use the code. Feel free to scoop it up if you're studying electronics and want a simple tool that can assist. 

UPDATE: Turns out I got really bored.

When I publish the V1 of the app you'll be greeted with the screen below.
Currently There is only one test that you can do, which is comprised of 10 questions.
Clicking on the "OHM'S LAW TEST" button will generate your test.

Upon entering your test there are at this point only 4 different types of questions: 
1) Calculating Voltage
2) Calculating Resistance
3) Calculating Amperage
4) Calculating LED Resistance

 When you start the test the "OHM'S LAW TEST" button will be temporarily disabled until the end of the test unless you click the "EXIT TEST" button. A text input box will then generage below to add your answers to it.

 The test will let you know the answer at the end and if you got it correct.
 There's also a score at the top :)
