This is just a little project I decide to put some time into one night because I wanted to memorize Ohm's Law and it's variations. I might continue on and add more functionality to it, and if I get really damn bored I'll give it a GUI and make it pretty.
Anyone's welcome to use the code. Feel free to scoop it up if you're studying electronics and want a simple tool that can assist.
